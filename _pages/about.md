About me
======
I am a first-year Ph.D. student  at Department of Computer Science and Engineering in The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), supervised by [Irwin King](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/irwin.king/home/). Previously, I started my research in Sun Yat-Sen University, fortunately advised by [Qinliang Su](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cuIweygAAAAJ&hl=en).



## Research Interest

My research interests are machine learning/deep learning and their broad applications in natural language processing and information retrieval. My past main research topics include: (i) Product quantization for efficient dense (documents/passages) retrieval; (ii) Learning to hash for efficient image retrieval.
