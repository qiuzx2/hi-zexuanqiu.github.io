About me
======
I am a first-year Ph.D. student  at Department of Computer Science and Engineering in The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), supervised by [Irwin King](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/irwin.king/home/). Previously, I started my research in Sun Yat-Sen University, fortunately advised by [Qinliang Su](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cuIweygAAAAJ&hl=en).



## Research Interest

My general research interest is probabilistic machine learning and its application in Natural Language Processing. Currently, I am specifically interested in: (i) (Binary/ Product) Quantization for efficient retrieval; (ii) Quantization of Pre-trained Language Models.
